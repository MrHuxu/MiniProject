#Question Collector

This project is written to be used to collect questions in interview, and I use all my RoR and JS knowledge to finish this task.  

Here are some of the dependences of this project:  

1. Ruby 2.1.2, you shuld use 2.0+.  

2. Rails 4.1.5, don't use 4.1.6, it doesn't work!  

3. devise, this is the best authentication system with Rails.  

4. twitter-bootstrap-rails, pls use the bootstrap3 branch.    


I also want to add a omni-auth system in this project but there is not enough time, and because of many reasons, the source code won't have large changes in the future.
